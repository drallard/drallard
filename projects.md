### Harnessing the Microbiome to Support Food Safety and Security

Food is the fuel of human society, integral to health as well as cultural expression. However, there are many stressors on our food system today, including depletion of freshwater resources, pollution of both land and water, and increasing intensity of extreme weather. In order to feed the world’s population, which is both growing in number and shifting in diet toward more resource-intensive foods, forward-thinking interdisciplinary research will be essential. There is a pressing need for innovative solutions that decrease the environmental footprint of agriculture and increase its climate resiliency while maintaining food safety. A vast body of research has shown the integral role that microbiomes play in both human and environmental health. There is enormous unexplored potential in the microscopic world surrounding us. My goal is to harness this world to provide scalable and practical microbe-based solutions to the most pressing needs of agriculture today, and to work with farmers and policymakers to lead to tangible change.

### Microplastics in Terrestrial Agricultural Systems

Microplastics are a well-documented source of contamination in surface water and seafood, but little research has investigated the potential of microplastics to influence terrestrial food systems. The hydrophobic nature of these compounds in the environment can cause them to absorb toxic pollutants, and biomagnification of these contaminants through terrestrial food chains may exacerbate the exposure potential to humans.  However, research is only beginning to explore the consequences of their deposition in agricultural systems. Concern about environmental impacts of traditional nutrient and pest management approaches, as well as reduced availability of traditional irrigation water sources, has led to increased interest in alternative agricultural inputs. As a result, adoption of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation, biosolids and composts for nutrient management, and biodegradable plastic row cover for weed suppression has increased. However, these inputs are potential reservoirs for microplastics. Additionally, the risk that microplastics and their associated chemical contaminants pose to consumers if present in agricultural systems is not well understood. With an interdisciplinary multi-institution team of researchers, I am forming a collaboration to explore the microbial and chemical consequences of microplastics in soils.

### Every Drop Counts: Water, Food, and Global Public Health ([ENSP360](https://ntst.umd.edu/soc/201801/ENSP/ENSP360))
#### Spring 2018

In-depth interdisciplinary study of the public health issues related to water use for global food production. Topics included accessibility and availability of safe water for agriculture worldwide, potential microbiological and chemical hazards in agricultural water, alternative water sources such as reclaimed wastewater and return flows, food safety approaches to managing agricultural water, and agricultural influences on surface and groundwater quality. Political, social, and economic factors relating to agricultural water were addressed, with special focus on regions that are leaders in innovative water management and regions where access to clean water for agriculture is a major challenge. Classes included lectures, discussions, and field-trips.

# Community Engagement

### [San Diego Rapid Response Network](http://www.rapidresponsesd.org/)

The San Diego Rapid Response Network (SDRRN) is a coalition of human rights and service organizations, attorneys, and community leaders dedicated to aiding immigrants and their families in the San Diego border region. I volunteer with SDRRN as an airport guide, helping asylum seeking families navigate the airport on their journey to reunite with family or friends in the U.S. as they await immigration hearings.

Volunteer (2018-present).

# Hobbies

### [Yeast Culture Club](https://yeastcultureclub.wordpress.com) 

"Exploring the art and science of fermentation." This club was started by a small group of graduate students at the University of Maryland to facilitate a sense of community in the Plant Science and Landscape Architecture department and to explore new interests together. Over the course of ~4 years, the YCC brewed countless batches of beer, made botanically-scented soaps, foraged for and cooked with edible wild mushrooms and plants, fermented sauerkrauts, mustards, and hot sauces, dress-rehearsed defense presentations, and supported each other through the rollercoasters of graduate school and life. 

Founding member (2014), president (2014-2016), member (2014-2018).


### [Orfeia](https://orfeia.wordpress.com)

All-woman vocal ensemble dedicated to preserving and sharing traditional music from Bulgaria and Eastern Europe. Orfeia’s repertoire spans the rich and diverse musical heritage of Eastern Europe, Bulgaria, Russia, Georgia and the Balkans, from traditional to sacred and from the Middle Ages to modern day. The captivating sounds of the Balkans are given voice through lush harmonies, unique dissonances and vocal ornaments, unusual rhythms, village songs, custom songs with overlapping lines, antiphonal songs with drones, seasonal music, dance music, and children’s songs. Orfeia is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.

Former member (2009-2018), board member (2011-2018), treasurer (2011-2016), vice-president (2016-2018).
