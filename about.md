I currently work as a postdoctoral fellow for CONSERVE, a Center of Excellence at the Nexus of Sustainable Water Reuse, Food, and Health. I began my research career as an undergraduate, investigating the pollination efficiency and diversity of native bees on watermelon fields in the Mid-Atlantic. After receiving my B.A. in Biology from Haverford College in 2009, I began an ORISE fellowship in the Division of Microbiology at the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. At FDA, I participated in environmental sampling for foodborne pathogens, evaluation of a food safety biological control agent, and optimization of _Salmonella_ detection methods from environmental samples. As a graduate student in Plant Science at the University of Maryland, I studied the influence of farming practices and environmental conditions on plant microbiomes in the complex agricultural environment. As part of the CONSERVE team based in the UMD School of Public Health, I am primarily working to characterize the microbiomes of nontraditional irrigation water sources including surface water and reclaimed wastewater, and I also participate in farmer and community outreach. I am passionate about working towards the adoption of agricultural practices that are microbiologically safe, environmentally sustainable, and economically viable.

* Assessed the influence of on-farm conditions on the microbial ecology of
  tomato and cucumber plants in the agricultural environment through standard
  microbiological analysis as well as 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatic
  analysis.
* Completed dissertation: Bacterial communities of the tomato phyllosphere:
  response to soil amendment application, rainfall, and insect visitation.

### FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition

ORISE Fellow in the Division of Microbiology

* Evaluated reservoirs of Salmonella in agricultural environments on Virginiaâ€™s
  Eastern Shore.
* Compared efficacy of molecular and microbiological methods of Salmonella
  detection from farm- fresh and store-bought tomatoes.
* Conducted field, growth chamber, and high tunnel studies to investigate the
  potential of Paenibacillus alvei TS-15 as a food safety biological control
  agent.

### Bryn Mawr College Department of Biology
