I am an Assistant Project Scientist in the [Gilbert Lab](http://www.gilbertlaboratory.com/), housed between the University of California San Diego School of Medicine and Scripps Intitution of Oceanography. I am interested in exploring how we can harness microbiome research to support environmental recovery after disturbance, safe and productive food systems, and human health. To address growing challenges, such as the presence of emerging contaminants and increasing climate variability, I believe that interdisciplinary collaboration and stakeholder engagement will be essential. 

I began my research career as an undergraduate, investigating the pollination efficiency and diversity of native bees on watermelon fields in the Mid-Atlantic. After receiving my B.A. in Biology from Haverford College in 2009, I began an ORISE fellowship in the Division of Microbiology at the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. At FDA, I participated in environmental sampling for foodborne pathogens, evaluation of a food safety biological control agent, and optimization of _Salmonella_ detection methods from environmental samples. As a graduate student in Plant Science at the University of Maryland, I studied the influence of farming practices and environmental conditions on plant microbiomes in the complex agricultural environment. As part of the [CONSERVE](http://conservewaterforfood.org/) team based in the UMD School of Public Health, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow and Assistant Program Manager, primarily working to characterize the microbiomes of nontraditional irrigation water sources including surface water and reclaimed wastewater. I actively participated in farmer and community outreach and directed the CONSERVE Summer Intern Program.
