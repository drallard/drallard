author: Sarah Allard

Check out my latest [blog post](https://www.biotechniques.com/coronavirus-news/opinion_refocusing-our-microbiome-lab-for-sars-cov-2-research/) to learn about the process of quickly shifting our research efforts toward understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in the hospital environment. Normally when establishing a new research area, we have months, if not years to put together all the pieces of a study. In this case, we wanted to provide urgently-needed data as quickly and safely as possible. With the help of protocols from previous work in the built environment, sample labeling infrastructure from large-scale projects at UCSD, and an extraordinary team, we sped up the timeline.
