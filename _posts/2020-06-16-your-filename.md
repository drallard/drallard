## Refocusing our microbiome lab for SARS-CoV-2 research

Check out my latest [blog post](https://www.biotechniques.com/coronavirus-news/opinion_refocusing-our-microbiome-lab-for-sars-cov-2-research/) to learn about the process of quickly shifting our research efforts toward understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. Normally when establishing a new research area, you have months, if not years to put together all the pieces of a study. In this case, we wanted to provide urgently-needed data as quickly as possible, so the timeline had to be adjusted.
